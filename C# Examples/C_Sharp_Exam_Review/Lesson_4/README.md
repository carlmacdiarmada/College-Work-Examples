##Loops
Say you want run a piece of code multiple times, you could simply copy and paste it out that number of times but that
would be a lot of work and think about a scenario where you don't know how many times you want to repeat the code. This
is where loops come in. There are a few different types of loops, as well as a concept called recursion which we'll talk
about in the next lesson.
###for
```C#
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```
###foreach
