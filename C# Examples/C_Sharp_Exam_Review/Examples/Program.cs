			//The result is Barry McDermott instead of Carl McDermott despite only changing this in B and not in A
			//the reason for this is because objects are a thing called reference types
			//reference types copy a reference (kind of like a website address) to the object when one object is put = another
			//this means that when you change the value in one it changes in any copies of it because they are all the same 
			//actual object (Say a website has multiple addresses and you change the content all the addresses now point to 
			//the new content)

			//sets the real part of z to 1
			z.Real = 1f;

			//prints out new z
			Console.WriteLine ("z = " + z);
			//prints out y
			Console.WriteLine ("y = " + y);
			//notice y hasn't changed even though we changed z after making it a copy of y
			//this is because structs are what we call data types
			//data types copy the values instead of the location of the values
			//this is very useful in mathematical programs and games

			//creates a List of animals called Zoo
			//C# Lists are basically dynamic arrays (arrays which can bigger as you add more members)
			//not to be confused with LinkedList which is not the same as an array at all (look them up)
			//Look at Animal.cs
			List<Animal> zoo = new List<Animal>();
			//adds element to list zoo
			//the element added is a Lion object (look at Lion.cs)
			//This works because Lion inherits animal
			//This is called polymorhpism

			//foreach loops can be used with Lists and array to iterate through each element
			//foreach(type name in List) is the format
			foreach (Animal resident in zoo) {

				Console.WriteLine (resident);
				//notice that the output is 
				//Lion: Simba 4 years
				//Bear: Baloo 5 years
				//Lion: King Richard 40 years
				//for this section
				//this is the result of the Lion and Bear objects overrides on the ToString method
			}
			//another example of the override
			foreach (Animal resident in zoo) {
				//prints out the result of the makeNoise method from animal
				//the list zoo is a list of animals so if Bear or Lion had methods that weren't overrides from 
				//Animal they would give an error if they were called on an element of zoo
				Console.WriteLine (resident.Name + " says " + resident.makeNoise());
				//This prints out different results for Lions and Bears
			}

			//Print out the name and age of element 0 in zoo
			Console.WriteLine(zoo[0].Name + " is  " + zoo [0].Age);
			//calls hasBirthday on element 0 of zoo
			zoo [0].hasBirthday ();
			//Print out the name and age of element 0 in zoo again
			Console.WriteLine(zoo[0].Name + " is  " + zoo [0].Age);
			//notice that this method works even though it is not in the Lion object code
			//this is because the method is inherited
